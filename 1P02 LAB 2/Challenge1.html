  Etymology
</h2>

  <p>
    While a <em>variety of theories</em> have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now <br>
    accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning <em>"village"</em> or <em>"settlement"</em>.[9] In <br>
    1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer <br>
    Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that <br>
    particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European <br>
    books and maps had begun referring to this region as Canada.[10] <br>

  <p>
    In the 17th and early 18th centuries, <strong>"Canada"</strong> referred to the part of New France that lay along the St.<br>
    Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada <br>
    collectively named The Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12] Upon <br>
    Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word Dominion <br>
    was conferred as the country's title.[13] The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in <br>
    1982 with the passage of the Canada Act, which refers only to Canada. Later that year, the national holiday <br>
    was renamed from Dominion Day to <strong>Canada Day</strong>.[14] The term "Dominion" is also used to distinguish the <br>
    federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term "federal" had replaced <br>
    "dominion".[15]

    History
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Aboriginal peoples
  </h3>

  <p>
    Aboriginal peoples in present-day Canada include the <em>First Nations, Inuit, and Métis</em>,[16] the latter being a <br>
    mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when <strong>First Nations</strong> and Inuit people married <br>
    European settlers.[16] Archaeological studies and genetic analyses have indicated a human presence in the <br>
    northern <em>Yukon region</em> from 13,000–12,000 BC and in southern Ontario from 7500 BC.[17][18] These first <br>
    settlers entered Canada through Beringia by way of the Bering land bridge.[19]

  <h3>
    European colonization
  </h3>

  <p>
    The first known attempt at European colonization began when Norsemen settled briefly at L'Anse aux <br>
    Meadows in Newfoundland around 1000 AD.[32] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when <br>
    Italian seafarer <em>John Cabot</em> explored Canada's Atlantic coast for England.[33] Then Basque and Portuguese <br>
    mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in the early 16th <br>
    century.[34] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the <strong>St. Lawrence River</strong>, where, on July 24, he <br>
    planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words "Long Live the King of France" and took possession of the <br>
    territory in the name of King Francis I.[35]
