    <h1>
      CSS modules
    </h1>


      <p>
        As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into <br>
         <span class= "bigtxt">modules</span>. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation <br>
         pages are organized around a particular module. <span class= "font">For example</span>, you could take a look at the MDN <br>
         reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties <br>
         and features it contains. In that module, you will also find a link to <span class="upper">Specifications</span> that defines the <br>
         technology (also see the section below).
      </p>

      <h1>
        CSS specifications

        <p id = "rightbody">
           New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group â€” sometimes because a <br>
           particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and <br>
           developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a <br>
           requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key <br>
           thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break <br>
           old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a <br>
           browser today!
