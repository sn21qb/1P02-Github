<h1>
  CSS modules
</h1>


  <p>
    As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into <br>
     <em>modules</em>. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation <br>
     pages are organized around a particular module. <strong>For example</strong>, you could take a look at the MDN <br>
     reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties <br>
     and features it contains. In that module, you will also find a link to <em>Specifications</em> that defines the <br>
     technology (also see the section below).

    CSS specifications
  </h1>

    <p>
       New CSS features are developed or specified by the <em>CSS Working Group</em> â€” sometimes because a <br>
       particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and <br>
       developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a <br>
       requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. <strong>However</strong>, a key <br>
       thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break <br>
       old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a <br>
       browser today!
