Etymology
While a variety of theories have been postulated for the <br>
etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted <br>
as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, <br>
meaning "village" or "settlement".[9] In 1535, indigenous <br>
inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word <br>
to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.<br>
[10] <strong> Cartier </strong> later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular <br>
village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] <br>
by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as Canada.[10]
In the 17th and early 18th centuries, "Canada" referred to the part of New France <br>
 that lay along the St. Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British <br>
  colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas; <br>
  until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12] Upon Confederation <br>
  in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word Dominion <br>
  was conferred as the country's title.[13] The transition away from the use of Dominion <br>
   was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act, which refers only to <br>
   Canada. Later that year, the national holiday was renamed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[14] <br>
   The term "Dominion" is also used to distinguish the federal government from the <br>
    provinces, though after the Second World War the <br>
  term "federal" had replaced "dominion".[15]
