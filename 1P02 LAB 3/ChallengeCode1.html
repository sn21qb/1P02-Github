			<strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
			industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br>
			text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
			of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br>
			survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
			typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
			the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br>
			Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br>
			software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br>
    making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br>
    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of <br>
    the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br>
    passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br>
    literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br>
    comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum <br>
    et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <br>
    45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br>
    during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem <br>
    ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
